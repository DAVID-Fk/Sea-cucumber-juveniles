# Sea-cucumber-juveniles

This repository was created to upload the data that support the findings of the paper "Sea cucumber juveniles show great potential to diversify shellfish aquaculture in temperate zones" by David et al. (2023).

It consists of five tables (growth data and compositions of fatty acids, amino acids, pigments and stable isotopes).

The first columns are commun to all tables although the sample list may vary in length.

- Id refers to an individual identifier for the sea cucumber in the form BW_FXX_XX where BW stands for body wall, F (or M or Unknown) for sex, XX for the number of individual.

- splMass refers to the weight of sample that was used to conduct the analysis.

- StdC23 (only in the fatty acid table) refers to the amount of C23 standard added to the sample (in ug).

  - Amino acids are reported as % of total amino acids.

  - Fatty acids are reported as the area of the FID signal correponding to each fatty acid. Fatty acid are annotated in the form Ca.bwc where a refers to the number of carbons, b to the number of double bounds and c to the position of the first double bound from the end of chain.

  - Pigments are reported as absolute concentrations in mg per g of dry material.
  
  - Stable isotopes are reported relative to authentic standards.
